# Portfolio 

## Description
A portfolio of coding projects built in the course of completing U. Penn's full stack coding bootcamp as well as technical documents produced in CSULB's technical and professional certification program. 

## Challenges
Given that this was one of the final projects in my coding program, but one that I will continue to update beyond that, one of my major challenges has been preventing myself from getting stuck on trying to make every aspect perfect. Luckily I've recently had a lot of practice in prioritizing, so I've managed to not get too hung up on minutiae and continue making progress where I can. 

Prop drilling has been an ongoing challenge, and my top priority in terms of functionality and best practices. Aside from that, shape of this project has shifted from the original design, and many opportunities for polish are available in terms of distilling functions into more discrete componenets and cleaning up my folder structure. 

## Installation
```git clone``` 

```npm install```

```npm start```

## ToDo List 
- lazy loading for images
- responsive breakpoints, especially for landscape view
